# AI Lawyer Feature Refactoring

This directory contains a refactored version of the AI Lawyer feature, which was previously implemented in a single large component (`frontend/src/pages/lawyer/AILawyerPageNew.tsx`). The refactoring breaks down the functionality into smaller, more manageable pieces using a modern React architecture with hooks, context, and component composition.

## Why Refactor?

The original `AILawyerPageNew.tsx` component had grown to over 2,400 lines of code, making it difficult to:
- Maintain and debug
- Understand the relationship between different pieces of functionality
- Fix specific issues (like the Quick Actions functionality)
- Reuse code across different parts of the application

## Architecture

The refactored code follows a more modular architecture:

```
frontend/src/features/aiLawyer/
├── components/            # UI components
│   ├── AILawyerPage.tsx   # Main container component
│   ├── DocumentSelector.tsx # File selection UI
│   └── QuickActions/      # Quick actions related components
│       ├── QuickActionsPanel.tsx # Quick actions UI
│       └── ResultDialog.tsx # Results display
├── hooks/                 # Custom hooks for business logic
│   ├── useDocumentSelection.ts # Document selection logic
│   └── useQuickActions.ts # Quick actions handling
└── context/               # Shared state management
    └── AILawyerContext.tsx # Context provider
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - UI components are focused solely on rendering
   - Business logic is extracted into custom hooks
   - Shared state is managed through context

2. **Maintainability**:
   - Each file has a single responsibility
   - Files are much smaller (typically under 300 lines)
   - Functionality is easier to understand and debug

3. **Fixed Issues**:
   - Document selection and quick actions functionality has been stabilized
   - Session storage handling is more robust
   - Better error handling and logging

## How to Use

The refactored component is available at the route `/lawyer/ai-new/:clientId`, which runs alongside the original implementation.

## Migration Plan

1. **Current Stage**: The refactored version runs alongside the original to allow testing and validation
2. **Testing Period**: Both versions will be available while testing confirms all functionality works correctly
3. **Final Migration**: After successful testing, the routes will be updated to use the new version exclusively
4. **Cleanup**: After the migration is complete, the original `AILawyerPageNew.tsx` will be removed

## Known Limitations

- Some complex functionality like feedback forms and TTS hasn't been fully migrated yet
- The existing `ChatInterface` component from the original implementation is still being used
- More test coverage is needed

## Next Steps

1. Complete migration of all functionality
2. Add comprehensive test coverage
3. Refactor the `ChatInterface` component into smaller pieces
4. Update documentation with more detailed API information
